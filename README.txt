# UnixBashScript

A simple yet elegant unix script that switches file formatting while changing student marking scheme. 
Topics Learned while working on the project: Argument parsing in BASH, positional parameters, implementing options to 
convert between two file formats:

• MarkUs format: A CSV file of student UTORids. Example:
  abc ,73
  def ,79
  ghi ,76
• Registrar’s Office format: A CSV file of student IDs. Example:
  100001 ,79
  100002 ,73
  100003 ,76
